The current tag year started in April 2022 and will end in March 2023 with a free tournamnet for all tag holders for a trophy. Tag bags are a way to support the club financially while also showing your progress at our leagues. During league turn in your tag to the TD and depending on how you do you will either get a better tag, a worse tag or keep the same tag. You can also challenge anyone you see with a bag tag to a bag tag round at the course and the winner gets the lower tag.</p>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 1: 380ft. This is where it all starts. A tough uneven green makes parking this hole difficult. Being above the basket presents challenges of sailing on your second shot. The safe shot it a straight shot with a little hyzer. Advatage to lefties and forehand dominant righties</h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 2: 393ft. This hole is closer then it looks. Putters and midranges are never a bad idea. Watch for how the winds shift and notice the flight of the Hawks to get a sense of your line.</h5>


          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 3: 280ft. Another challenging green. Whichever line you take you have to get your shot below the tree canopy. There is a small opening behind the tree but the main route is to aim at the tree on the right with some slight fade to the left.</h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 4: 451ft. Enjoy the view at one of the higest points in the area. Several lines can work here but you'll have to give it a big throw if you want to make it onto the green. The guardian trees are very grippy and hard to get your discs out of if you get them stuck high.</h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 5: 345ft. For some reason the pole in the field seems to draw the disc. Other then the early issues this is a fairly simple right ro left shot but the hill makes it hard to get close to the basket. Being under the tree to the left is especially tough</h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 6: 398ft. Watch out not to go so far right that you end up in the bushes, there is some poison oak if you rummage too much in those bushes. The green has some low ceiling that is a little more open to the left side then the right side but the right side is easier to get distance to the basket. </h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 7: 267ft. The straight shot is always a beatiful play with a putter or midrange. The big right hyzer shot is a safe play as long as you avoid the wires. Going left to right is a interesting play as well.</h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 8: 293ft. This is the most scenic and serene hole on the course. The oak grove frames a beautiful left to right shot with a large guardian tree that makes the right to left play very hard to execute. Players with big arms should consider the skyzer shot over all the trees. </h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 9: 520ft. The final hole. After all your hard work you get rewarded with what is your longest drive and can you do it twice? If you don't get the birdie don't worry, just play another round!</h5>
