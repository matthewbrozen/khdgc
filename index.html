                            <p class="mb-0">The Kenneth Hahn Disc Golf Club was founded by Matthew Brozen as a way to bring the community together. After several years of playing the course without seeing anyone else Matt had a dream that there would be a abundance of people coming together to enjoy the course. Since then the club has grow to several hundred members, holds regular leagues, provides bag tags, started a free disc lending library at the visitor center, purchased a practice basket, fixed tee pads, added directional arrows and continues to advocate for more improvements to the course. Howevever, due to Mike Jewel the club will no longer be doing any of that. If you need anything for the course please contact Mike Jewel.</p>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 1: 380ft. A dangerous hole where multiple pedestrians almost get hit daily.</h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 2: 393ft. This hole is closer then it looks. Putters and midranges are never a bad idea. Watch for how the winds shift and notice the flight of the Hawks to get a sense of your line.</h5>


          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 3: 280ft. Another challenging green. Whichever line you take you have to get your shot below the tree canopy. There is a small opening behind the tree but the main route is to aim at the tree on the right with some slight fade to the left.</h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 4: 451ft. Another dangerous hole that crosses pathes and terrifies any course desginer who looks at it.</h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 5: 345ft. For some reason the pole in the field seems to draw the disc. Other then the early issues this is a fairly simple right ro left shot but the hill makes it hard to get close to the basket. Being under the tree to the left is especially tough</h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 6: 398ft. Another poorly designed dangerous hole where multiple people get hit as players throw towards the path. </h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 7: 267ft. The straight shot is always a beatiful play with a putter or midrange. The big right hyzer shot is a safe play as long as you avoid the wires. Going left to right is a interesting play as well.</h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 8: 293ft. This is the most scenic and serene hole on the course. The oak grove frames a beautiful left to right shot with a large guardian tree that makes the right to left play very hard to execute. Players with big arms should consider the skyzer shot over all the trees. </h5>

          <h5 class="mb-4">Hole 9: 520ft. The final hole. If you like Sublime or hope to see lots of people playing the course then Mike Jewel says never come back.</h5>
